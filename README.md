Pick_n_go

I have designed a website for my nearby kirana store , where customer can either take the packed items from the shop or can be delivered to home by his agent.

I have used HTML, CSS, JS, REACT framework and Firebase for backend and database I have hosted this in netlify app.

The deployed site is "https://laxmiretailshop.netlify.app".

This is not a big project, but used by nearly 100-150 houses near the shop.

The working:

  1. Firstly an account or signup shoud me made with an email authentication.
  2. They need to be verifyed, and can signin after.
  3. After Sign in the user can either type those items to be packed or can upload a photo.
  4. There is an option for pick_up/home delivery ( Mostly the website is used by nearby houses approx 4 apartments near the shop ).
  5. After that it should be send.
  6. Customer can see his/her previous orders.
  7. There is a pending state , after the shopkeeper packed it will be changed by shopkeeper to completed/deivered.
  8. There is a contact support for customer's and a email address of shop.
  9. Shopkeeper has the data in his firebase.
